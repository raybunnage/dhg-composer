## Documentation Emojis
Common emojis used throughout the documentation:

### Quick Access
- üöÄ - Getting started, launches
- üìö - Documentation, guides
- üîß - Tools, utilities, configuration
- üèóÔ∏è - Architecture, structure
- üîí - Security, authentication
- üß™ - Testing
- üîå - Integrations, plugins
- üìù - Notes, documentation
- ‚ö†Ô∏è - Warnings, important notes
- üí° - Tips, ideas

### How to Use Emojis
1. **System Shortcuts**:
   - Windows: `Windows key + .` (period)
   - Mac: `Command + Control + Space`
   - Linux: Varies by distribution, often `Ctrl + .` or `Super + .`

2. **Direct Copy/Paste**:
   - Copy from this reference
   - Use system emoji picker
   - Copy from emoji websites

3. **Markdown Emoji Codes** (platform dependent):
   ```markdown
   :rocket: = üöÄ
   :books: = üìö
   :wrench: = üîß
   :lock: = üîí
   ```

### Best Practices
- Use emojis consistently across documentation
- Don't overuse - one emoji per heading is sufficient
- Ensure emojis add meaning rather than decoration
- Consider accessibility - always pair emojis with clear text
