## Monorepo vs Multi-App: A Beginner's Guide

/my-project/              # One main house
├── apps/                 # Different rooms
│   ├── web-app/         # Living room
│   ├── mobile-app/      # Bedroom

Pros:
Share code easily (like sharing furniture between rooms)
Single version control (one key for the whole house)
Easier dependency management (one maintenance schedule)
Simplified CI/CD (one security system)
Better code visibility (see everything from one place)
Cons:
Can get large and complex (big house = more maintenance)
Slower git operations on large codebases
Requires good organization (need house rules)
Team coordination needed (family meetings)
Your Current Multi-App Approach
Looking at your tree, you're currently using a more separated approach:

/dhg-composer/
├── backend/            # Separate Python application
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── requirements/
├── frontend/           # Separate frontend application
└── scripts/           # Shared tools

This is more like having separate buildings in a compound:
Each app is independent (separate buildings)
Clear boundaries (different addresses)
Separate concerns (different purposes)
Pros of Your Approach:
Clear separation of concerns
Independent deployment possible
Easier to understand each part
Team can work independently
Smaller, focused codebases
Cons of Your Current Setup:
Code sharing is harder
Duplicate code possible
Version synchronization challenges
More complex deployment
Multiple repositories to manage
Which Are You Following?
Based on your structure, you're following a hybrid approach leaning towards multi-app:
You have clear separation (backend/frontend)
But everything is in one repository
You use shared scripts
You maintain unified documentation
Recommendation
For your scale and setup, your current approach makes sense because:
It's simpler to start with
You have clear boundaries
You can still share code when needed
It's easier to understand for new team members
However, you might want to consider adding some monorepo benefits:
Create a packages/ directory for shared code
Use workspace tools (pnpm/yarn workspaces)
Implement better dependency sharing
Set up unified CI/CD
Would you like me to elaborate on any of these aspects or provide specific implementation details for improving your current setup?
