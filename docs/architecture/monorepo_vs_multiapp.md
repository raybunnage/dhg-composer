# Monorepo vs Multi-App: A Beginner's Guide

## Overview
This guide explains the differences between monorepo and multi-app approaches to help you understand our project structure decisions.

## Monorepo Approach
Think of a monorepo like a single big house with many rooms:

```
/my-project/              # One main house
├── apps/                 # Different rooms
│   ├── web-app/         # Living room
│   ├── mobile-app/      # Bedroom
│   └── admin-portal/    # Office
├── packages/            # Shared furniture
│   ├── ui-components/   # Shared decorations
│   ├── utils/          # Shared tools
│   └── types/          # Shared rules
└── services/           # Utilities
    ├── auth/           # Security system
    └── database/       # Storage
```

### Monorepo Advantages
- **Code Sharing**: Like sharing furniture between rooms
  - Easy to reuse components
  - Consistent styling and utilities
  - Shared type definitions

- **Version Control**: One key for the whole house
  - Single source of truth
  - Atomic commits across apps
  - Easier to track changes

- **Dependency Management**: One maintenance schedule
  - Consistent versions across apps
  - Single update process
  - Reduced dependency conflicts

- **CI/CD**: One security system
  - Unified deployment pipeline
  - Consistent testing
  - Simpler automation

### Monorepo Challenges
- Can become large and complex
- Slower git operations on large codebases
- Requires good organization
- Needs team coordination

## Understanding Atomic Commits

### What Are Atomic Commits?
An atomic commit is a commit that represents a single, complete change across all affected parts of the system. In a monorepo, this means you can update multiple apps or packages in a single commit when they're related.

### Example of Atomic Commits
Consider changing a user interface across your system:

```bash
# In a monorepo, one commit can include:
- frontend/components/UserCard.tsx    # Updated component
- backend/schemas/user.py            # Updated user schema
- packages/types/user.ts             # Updated shared types
- apps/admin/views/UserView.tsx      # Updated admin view

# Commit message:
"feat: update user card to include email verification status"
```

### Benefits of Atomic Commits in Monorepo
1. **Consistency**
   - All related changes stay together
   - No partial updates
   - Everything updates at once

2. **Traceability**
   - Easy to track feature implementation
   - Clear history of system-wide changes
   - Simple rollback if needed

3. **Code Review**
   - See all related changes together
   - Understand full impact of changes
   - Review complete features

### Without Atomic Commits (Multi-App)
In a multi-app setup, the same change might require multiple commits:

```bash
# Repository 1: Frontend
commit: "Update user card component"

# Repository 2: Backend
commit: "Update user schema"

# Repository 3: Shared Types
commit: "Update user types"
```

This can lead to:
- Synchronization issues
- Harder to track changes
- More complex deployments
- Risk of partial updates

## Our Current Multi-App Approach
Our project uses a more separated approach:

```
/dhg-composer/
├── backend/            # Separate Python application
│   ├── src/
│   ├── tests/
│   └── requirements/
├── frontend/           # Separate frontend application
└── scripts/           # Shared tools
```

Think of this as separate buildings in a compound:
- Each app is independent (separate buildings)
- Clear boundaries (different addresses)
- Separate concerns (different purposes)

### Multi-App Advantages
1. **Clear Separation**
   - Independent codebases
   - Focused functionality
   - Clear responsibilities

2. **Deployment Flexibility**
   - Independent deployments
   - Different release cycles
   - Isolated scaling

3. **Team Organization**
   - Clear ownership
   - Independent development
   - Reduced merge conflicts

4. **Simplified Understanding**
   - Smaller codebases
   - Focused documentation
   - Clear entry points

### Multi-App Challenges
1. **Code Sharing**
   - Harder to share code
   - Potential duplication
   - Version synchronization

2. **Deployment Complexity**
   - Multiple pipelines
   - Service coordination
   - Environment management

## Our Hybrid Approach
We currently use a hybrid approach that combines benefits of both:

### What We're Doing
1. **Structure**
   - Separate backend/frontend
   - Single repository
   - Shared scripts
   - Unified documentation

2. **Benefits We Get**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Code sharing when needed
   - Single repository management
   - Unified development process

### Future Improvements
We're considering adding more monorepo benefits:

1. **Shared Code**
   ```
   /packages/
   ├── ui-components/
   ├── utils/
   └── types/
   ```

2. **Workspace Tools**
   - Package management
   - Dependency sharing
   - Build orchestration

3. **Development Tools**
   - Unified linting
   - Shared testing utilities
   - Common CI/CD pipelines

## Best Practices

### Version Control
```bash
# Branch naming
feature/frontend/new-feature
feature/backend/api-update

# Commits
feat(frontend): add new component
feat(backend): implement API endpoint
```

### Code Sharing
```typescript
// In shared package
export interface User {
  id: string;
  name: string;
}

// Use in any app
import { User } from '@my-org/types';
```

### Development Workflow
1. Work in feature branches
2. Use consistent naming
3. Share common utilities
4. Maintain documentation

## Conclusion
Our hybrid approach provides:
- Clear separation where needed
- Code sharing when beneficial
- Simple starting point
- Room for growth

This structure supports our current needs while allowing for future scaling and additional features.
