# Authorization

## Introduction
Authorization is the process of determining what an authenticated user is allowed to do within an application. It ensures that users can only access resources and perform actions that they are permitted to. This document provides an overview of authorization concepts and best practices.

## Key Concepts

1. **Roles and Permissions**:
   - **Roles**: A role is a collection of permissions that define what actions a user can perform. Common roles include Admin, Editor, and Viewer.
   - **Permissions**: Specific rights to perform certain actions, such as read, write, delete, or update resources.

2. **Access Control Models**:
   - **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Users are assigned roles, and each role has specific permissions. This model simplifies management by grouping permissions into roles.
   - **Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)**: Access is granted based on attributes (e.g., user attributes, resource attributes, and environment conditions). This model provides fine-grained control.
   - **Discretionary Access Control (DAC)**: Users have control over their own resources and can decide who else can access them.

3. **Policy-Based Access Control**:
   - Policies define rules that determine access based on conditions. Policies can be written in languages like XACML or using custom logic.

## Best Practices

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks. This reduces the risk of unauthorized access.
- **Separation of Duties**: Divide responsibilities among different roles to prevent conflicts of interest and reduce the risk of fraud.
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review roles and permissions to ensure they align with current business needs and security policies.
- **Dynamic Access Control**: Implement real-time access control checks to adapt to changing conditions and threats.

## Implementation Guidelines

- **Define Roles and Permissions**: Clearly define roles and their associated permissions based on business requirements.
- **Use Middleware**: Implement authorization checks in middleware to ensure consistent enforcement across the application.
- **Centralized Management**: Use a centralized system to manage roles and permissions, making it easier to update and audit.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: Log authorization decisions and monitor for unusual access patterns to detect potential security issues.

## Error Handling

- **Consistent Error Messages**: Provide clear and consistent error messages when access is denied, without revealing sensitive information.
- **User Feedback**: Inform users why access was denied and provide guidance on how to request additional permissions if needed.

## Conclusion
Authorization is a critical component of application security, ensuring that users can only access resources and perform actions they are authorized for. By following best practices and implementing robust authorization mechanisms, we can protect sensitive data and maintain the integrity of our application.
